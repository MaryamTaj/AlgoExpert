def sortedSquaredArray(array):
    # 1. Clarify assumptions:
    # Can you have an empty array? No.
    # Are the integers distinct? Yes, because the list is sorted in ascending
    # order, not non-descending order.
    # Can you have negative values? Yes, and this is important because 
    # they can affect the ascending order of the array postcondition.
    # E.g. [-2, -1] should return [1, 4]

    # 2. Write pseudo-code.
    # Initialize an empty array, squared_array.
    squared_array = []
    # Iterate through the original array.
    for i in range(0, len(array)):
        # At each iteration, square the value and append it to squared_array.
        square = array[i] * array[i]
        squared_array.append(square)
    # Sort and return the squared_array.
    squared_array.sort()
    return squared_array
